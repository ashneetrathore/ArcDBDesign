# :weight_lifting: THE ARC DATABASE DESIGN

## :open_book: OVERVIEW
Date: October 2023\

Based on assignment instructions from Prof. Mary Roth

This repository presents a relational database design for the Anteater Recreation Center (ARC), a gym located on the University of California, Irvine campus. The purpose of the database is to support core gym operations such as member management, event enrollment, employee scheduling, and facility usage. The project consists of three main parts: an **entity relationship diagram (ERD)**, a **relational notation** document, and a **schema** implementation with a **MySQL** script. 

The repo also includes a system requirements narrative that informed the modeling decisions and schema constraints throughout the design process. Certain requirements, such as the presence of sensor technology, were intentionally extended for design exploration purposes and do not necessarily reflect current ARC operations.
